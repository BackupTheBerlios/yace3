There is still no configure script, if you want to compile this, edit the Makefile as appropriate and try make.

Required libraries:

GNU Common C++ v2 - tested with version 1.0.13
http://www.gnu.org/software/commonc++/

mysql++ - C++ wrapper for libmysqlclient
http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-mysql++.html
Note: You will have to apply patches for GCC (see url)

Note that if you have the YaCE3 running, you need to specify a valid path to a gzipped tarball which contains the sourcecode of YOUR SPECIFIC version of the YaCE3. See COPYING for more details.

If you want to help us, submit patches, questions, suggestions or whatever you want to the YaCE3 mailing list at yace3-devel@nongnu.org.
